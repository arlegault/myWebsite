    <p>I call this chart "persistence".

We launched a new a feature months ago that had promise to add a lot of value for our customers. It was slightly risky as it was a new approach no one had tried before. After a lot of effort and great customer feedback during testing, we started to believe this bet was going to work.

On launch day, goose egg. Not a single customer used it.

We scratched our heads. We talked to more customers who continued to validate us. We made a few small iterations. But week after week, no customers adopted it. It made no sense.

Now the doubt started to creep in. Leaders started to display a sense of dubiety. Stakeholders questioned if we should be spending time on a lost cause. Under all the internal pressure, we almost folded. We were considering abandoning our entire strategy in this area because the first feature within it we shipped could not get off the ground.

But we had conviction. This was a risk worth taking. So we kept pushing. Come hell or high water, we would crack the code on product adoption in April. We threw the kitchen sink at the problem. Then one day, we finally saw someone successfully use our feature. Then another. We now have over 50% customer adoption and growing fast.

The line between doubling down on a losing bet and a story like this one isn't always clear.

At Carta, we optimize for taking risks and having the patience to let our teams play it out. As Henry often says: If you ask most companies, what do you do when somebody tries something and they fail at it? They'll say, "Well, we're an outcome-based company. Results matter." We're an input based company, not an output based company. The results will be the results. What we question is did we do it the right way?

In this case, did we move with urgency to try everything to make this work.

It's incredibly important for product teams to have room to fail. Failure brings learnings. Persevering through failure is how we see big bets eventually pay off. This chart here is the perfect embodiment of these principles at work.

If this is the kind of product team you want to work with, I am hiring. Come build with us. </p>
