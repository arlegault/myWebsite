    <p>I call this chart "persistence".

How do you know when to be persistent and when to give up?

But we had conviction. This was a risk worth taking. So we kept pushing. 
Come hell or high water, we would crack the code on product adoption in April. 
We threw the kitchen sink at the problem. Then one day, we finally saw someone 
successfully use our feature. Then another. We now have over 50% customer 
adoption and growing fast.

The line between doubling down on a losing bet and a story like this one isn't always clear.

At Carta, we optimize for taking risks and having the patience to let our teams 
play it out. As Henry often says: If you ask most companies, what do you do 
when somebody tries something and they fail at it? They'll say, "Well, we're 
an outcome-based company. Results matter." We're an input based company, not an 
output based company. The results will be the results. What we question is did we 
do it the right way?
