<h2>I'm Alex</h2>
<p  style="text-align:center;"><img src ='AL_headshot.jpeg'></p>
<p>I like building and learning. I get to do both of those things through a career in product management.
    For the past decade+, I've been leading product teams at <a href="https://pitchbook.com" target="_blank">PitchBook Data</a> and 
    <a href="https://carta.com/venture-capital/fund-administration/" target="_blank">Carta- Fund Admin</a> 
    building for private markets investors. My "sweet spot" has been joining teams in the 10-15M ARR 
    range and scaling them to 9 figures. Currently, I serve as a Senior Director of Product at Carta.
    <br>
    <br>
    Prior, I worked at early stage stage startups in Seattle and more tranditional companies like State Farm
    in a marketing capacity. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My degree is in psychology from the University of Washington where I focused on 
    what infleucnes which neural pathways are used in moral decision-making as well as sports psychology. For
    fun, I also spent a year living in Bogota, Colombia meeting family and improving my spanish. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond the office, I build and learn through hobbies like reading, 
    fishing, hunting, skiing, and flying. I use this website as a sort of diary 
    that has the added benefit of letting other people get to know me.
    <br>
    <br>
