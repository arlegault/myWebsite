<h1>I'm Alex</h1>
<p>I like building and learning. By day, I channel these passions into a career in product management. Beyond the office, I exercise them through hobbies like reading, fishing, hunting, skiing, and flying. Currently Seattle based and working at Carta. I use this website as a sort of diary that has the added benefit of letting other people get to know me.</p>
