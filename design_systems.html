<h2>Design Systems/h2>
<p> 
    I have a love hate relationship with design systems. 
    
    <strong>The case for them</strong>
    When I got to Carta, they already had a well defined system and component library. 
    I was blown away at the speed it enabled teams to move. Engineers with little to no 
    front end coding experience could grab components off the shelf to hack together 
    features that yielded a generally consistent and usable end product. 
    
    If UX resources were tied up, PMs could read the guidelines, take those same components of the shelf, and end up with something that didn't totally offend the design team. 
    
    Over time, this also meant that Carta needed less FE engineers
    
    At PitchBook, we often found ourselves fighting a battle of consistency. We had some semblance of a design system eventually, but we frequently violated it and constantly worried that low engagement with certain features was due ot lack of consistency. 
    
    <strong>The case against</strong>
    creates bad incentives
    -optimize for needs of the user (builder)vs optimize for consistency with system(system owner)? ex: wire inst
    -eng wants to do easy thing (system) vs PM/other do what they think user needs</p>
